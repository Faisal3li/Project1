# Trachef
Your fitness and diet are the two essential elements to live a long, healthy life. Knowing what to eat, and what to do are ways to help you achieve that, and so I thought of a way of creating a community of users to help and share experiences with each other. choosing between a chef and a trainer you get to share your own observations and practices.

## Thought Process
At first, I drew the structure of my models, also showing an adaptive association with each other. I assembled well order links to my models to provide the user with a trouble-free experience. Secondly, I thought of ways of how the website would work, assigning suiteable names to elements, and then how to connect each part to it's necessary other. Finally I would then practice ways to make my code neater and more understandable.

## Unsolved Problems
I would really love to finish my website with a few more quirks like: Add types to posts, add comments and likes, date of posts, friend request, private messaging, and use Heroku.
