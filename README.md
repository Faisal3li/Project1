Board games have been played in most cultures and societies throughout centuries. Here I present to you a board game called _Tic-Tac-Toe_.It's a simple game, where the competitors have to use diffrent strategies to get three in a row either vertically, horizontally, or even diagonally. We have no idea who created the original game. An early alternative of Tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called Terni Lapilli.

## Thought Process
At first, I drew the structure of my models, also showing an adaptive association with each other. I assembled well order links to my models to provide the user with a trouble-free experience. Secondly, I thought of ways of how the website would work, assigning suiteable names to elements, and then how to connect each part to it's necessary other. Finally I would then practice ways to make my code neater and more understandable.

## Unsolved Problems
I would really love to finish my website with a few more quirks like: Add types to posts, add comments and likes, date of posts, friend request, and private messaging.
